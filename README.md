## Bioinformatician: 
### At the National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden, SciLifeLab.

I support research groups by performing bioinformatic analyses and developing workflows on [request](https://nbis.se/support/support.html). 
My bioinformatic expertise focuses on de novo genome assembly, but I am also able to perform other sequence based analyses, such as variant 
calling, amplicon analysis, ancient DNA analysis, and more. In addition to my support work, I'm currently helping develop a 
[genome assembly and annotation workflow](https://github.com/NBISweden/Earth-Biogenome-Project-pilot) for the Swedish Pilot Project 
in the Earth Biogenome Project. As part of my support work, I aim to make my work reproducible, using version control, workflow managers, 
and containerized software. I use [this template](https://github.com/mahesh-panchal/NBIS_project_template) as the starting point for my work,
keeping data, files, and code organised, and hopefully easy to follow and extend for those I support.

I'm adept at programming, and writing workflows in particular. I'm well versed in Bash scripting, as well being able to use Perl, awk, sed, 
and R too. I write workflows using the Nextflow workflow language, based on Groovy. I have used various other languages in the past 
including Java, C, C++, Turing, Haskell, Prolog, and Assembly, including database languages such as PostgresQL. I'm familiar with various 
markup and serialization languages such as Markdown, HTML, Wiki Markup, Latex, and YAML. In my work, I regularity use Git, Docker, and Singularity, 
as well as Github Actions and Makefiles for automation, and Gitpod as a development environment.

## Nf-core Maintainer and Nextflow Ambassador

I contribute to the nf-core and Nextflow community, helping answer questions and develop best-practice workflows.
- [A thank you from Phil Ewels on behalf of the nf-core community at the Nextflow summit](https://youtu.be/B-OqciShiHY?si=xGisdrmFm89g--8-&t=718)

I'm currently a [Nextflow Ambassador](https://www.nextflow.io/ambassadors.html), and an [nf-core Maintainer](https://nf-co.re/governance#maintainers).

## Instructor

I am a certified Carpentries Instructor. I have helped develop [The Carpentries Introduction to Nextflow](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/workflows-nextflow).

I'm a teaching assistant on the NBIS/Elixir Tools for Reproducible Research course, and engage in reguar team development:
